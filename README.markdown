# Kurogo Mobile Web

Kurogo is a PHP framework for delivering high quality, data driven customizable content to a wide
range of mobile devices. Its strengths lie in the customizable system that allows you to adapt
content from a variety of sources and easily present that to mobile devices from feature phones,
to early generation smart phones, to modern devices and tablets. It currently includes modules for:

* People directory
* News/RSS feeds
* Event Calendar
* Links
* Statistics
* About

## Online Guide

We strongly recommend developers read the (in progress) framework guide:

## History

This project is based off the original [MIT Mobile Framework](https://github.com/MIT-Mobile/MIT-Mobile-Web) and was adapted for use at [Harvard University](https://github.com/modolabs/Harvard-Mobile-Web).
If you have followed the progress of the Harvard project you will notice some improvements and differences:

* An overhauled configuration system with web-based administration interface
* A robust authentication system with support for many types of authentication authorities
* Authorization support to restrict access to content by user or group
* Many other small improvements to ease in customization

There are some parts of the project that are not present:

* Modules that have not been generalized are not included. Please refer to the [Harvard Mobile Web Repository](https://github.com/modolabs/Harvard-Mobile-Web) for modules that you do not find here. Some modules will eventually be generalized and folded into this project.
* Native API support. The API for native apps will be changing.
